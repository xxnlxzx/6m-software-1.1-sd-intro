### Windows (WSL)

WSL stands for Windows Subsytem for Linux which allows Windows 10/11 users to install a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Debian, etc). This enables the use of Linux tools such as Bash shell, completely integrated with Windows tools such as Windows File Explorer, Visual Studio Code, Edge and Chrome browsers. 

WSL2 is the latest version of WSL that ships with Windows 10 version 2005 and higher (Build 19041 and above) or Windows 11

> We will install WSL in **Module 3 - Java Spring Boot**. For the time being, Windows users are encouraged to stay with native Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell command line.
